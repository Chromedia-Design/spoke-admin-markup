                  Protecting your personal data is important to Spoke Health
                  (collectively, “Spoke Health” or “we”). When you use any of

                  collect information about you, including information that can
                  be used to identify you (“Personal Information”).
                  Additionally, we may collect Personal Information from other
                  third parties described in this Privacy Notice. In some cases,
                  the Personal Information we collect may include Protected
                  Health Information (“PHI”) as defined under the Health
                  Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (“HIPAA”), which
                  is a regulated subset of Personal Information. We collect this
                  data to provide you with the services and functionality that
                  you request (the “Services”), as well as for the other
                  purposes described in this Privacy Notice.

                      parties that offer programs, resources, content,

                      and wellbeing, condition management, benefits, financial
                      health, etc. (each a “Services Partner”). These Services
                      Partners are separate and distinct entities from Spoke
                      Health, but we may exchange Personal Information with them
                      as described in this Privacy Notice. If you agree to
                      accept the services offered by a Services Partner, such
                      agreement is solely between you and the Services Partner,
                      and any information you provide to or that is collected by
                      a Services Partner is subject to that Services Partner’s
                      Privacy Notice. We are not responsible for the privacy
                      practices or services of the Services Partner or any other
                      third party.

Web beacons can recognize certain types of information on your computer such as cookies, the time and date a page is viewed, and a description of the page where the web beacon is placed. We also may include web beacons in e-mail messages to record whether an email has been opened or whether certain links in such email have been clicked.</p>

															<strong>Online Analytics</strong>
															<p>We may use third-party analytics services, such as Google Analytics, to evaluate your use of the Site, compile reports on activity, collect demographic data, analyze performance metrics, and collect and evaluate other information related to the Platform.
