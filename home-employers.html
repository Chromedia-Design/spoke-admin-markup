						<h3>The best facilities</h3>
					</div>
					<p>At Spoke<span class="trademark">&trade;</span>, we work tirelessly to find the best quality facilities in your region, and then take advantage of market inefficiencies to find tremendous savings for our clients. By focusing our attention on only facilities that are dedicated to improving outcomes and driving down costs, we are able to access healthcare at the bottom end of the price spectrum, while still guaranteeing high outcomes.</p>

						<h3>An elegant solution</h3>
					</div>
					<p>We couple our extensive database of comparative data on local surgery alternatives with our industry-leading engagement platform, SurgeryHub<span class="trademark">&trade;</span>. SurgeryHub<span class="trademark">&trade;</span> is  a self-customizing system that seamlessly guides your employees through a shopping-like experience to compare alternatives which may save them and you money.  In addition to this HIPAA-compliant technology platform, we also provide a team of dedicated employee advocates to help empower your employees to make informed, outcome-driven decisions that generate tremendous savings for you.</p>
					<p class="lead">We’ve learned that if you want employees to shop for healthcare, you have to put them in an environment that emotionally resembles their other shopping experiences and behaviors.</p>
					<p>Getting employees to use a benefit is typically one of the greatest  challenges faced for even the most economically-attractive programs. Awareness campaigns are limited in the impact they can make in changing behaviors.</p>
					<p>SurgeryHub<span class="trademark">&trade;</span> addresses traditional shortcomings first by utilizing a suite of indicative tools to identify employees likely on a path to surgery and assigning a dedicated employee advocate and care navigator who personally contacts the employee and works with the employee from surgery scheduling through recovery.  By offering assistance and confidence at the exact moment an employee is making a decision, we are able to engage employees to make decisions that are right, both for their quality of care, and for the cost to them and you.</p>

						<h3>Quality matters</h3>
					</div>
					<p>Quality is more than just a nice perk. It is a key component in how SurgeryHub<span class="trademark">&trade;</span> works. Facilities that do not focus on improving outcomes and reducing complications can never hope to compete on cost with those that do. And the added cost from complications can rapidly inflate the overall cost of a surgery by multiples. By focusing on only facilities with the highest quality, determined through quantifiable outcomes (including incidences of complications, readmissions and other metrics), we are able to narrow our facility partners to only those that can provide the most economically cost-efficient services to your employees.</p>

						<h3>Business Model</h3>
					</div>
					<p>With our current database of procedure alternatives and platform to ensure that your employees make an informed decision, we save self-insured employees immensely over time. We offer a customizable savings model that allows you to determine how much of the price differential between our low cost alternatives and the patient’s default alternative you’d like to pass along to them as incentive to make an economic decision. We offer this service to employees at a low monthly rate per employee that allows them to recognize typical annual savings of 2.3 times invested capital (over the long term, this translates to savings of $158 per employee annually).</p>
