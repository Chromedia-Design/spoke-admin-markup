					<p>You know the cost of healthcare is increasing at an unsustainable rate. As a self-insured employer, every increase in costs affects you directly.</p>
					<h4>We help you get control of the largest segment of that spend, surgeries.</h4>
					<hr class="white marker">
					<p>By focusing on the most common procedures with the largest opportunity of savings, and rewarding your employees for making the quality and price decisions you want them to, we’re able to help you save a dramatic amount of money on your surgery expenditure.</p>
					<p>Spoke Health<span class="trademark">&trade;</span> works by leveraging the fact that  there is little to no correlation between surgery price and quality. To start, we help you save money by identifying the highest quality facilities then narrow that list to only include those facilities that provide those procedures for a competitive price. We then work on your behalf by building bundled case rates for these procedures with our partners, eliminating variance and increasing confidence for both the partner and you.</p>
