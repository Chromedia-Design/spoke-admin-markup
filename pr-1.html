				<p>Spoke Health<span class="trademark">&trade;</span> today announced the details of its new provider-affiliate program. Spoke gives a limited number of the highest rated local providers access to employees through non-negotiated, flexible arrangements.</p>
				<p>Spoke’s role is to facilitate a patient-provider transaction based on each party's greatest needs when surgical intervention is required, matching supply with demand.</p>
				<p>Spoke Health CEO, Richard Coyte, explained the goal of the program’s design:</p>
				<blockquote>
					<p>We designed our program to serve providers as much as anyone.</p>
					<p>We go direct to providers, eliminating the cost of supporting the out-of-control profit goals of insurance companies. Some people might not know that self-insured employers ‘rent’ provider networks, which means employees, employers and providers all pay the insurance companies’ in one way or another. By going directly to providers, we offer client-employees access to the best possible care; the providers access to prescreened patients; and savings to employers through competitive bundled case rates.</p>
					<p>What we’ve learned is that by serving the needs of both patients and providers, we generate value on both sides of the transaction.</p>
					<footer>— Richard Coyte, Spoke Health<span class="trademark">&trade;</span> CEO</footer>
				</blockquote>
				<p>That flexible arrangement gives the highest-rated local providers an opportunity to generate highly efficient revenue, optimize utilization and maximize their return on investment.</p>
				<p class="mt-2">
					Key benefits to providers include:
				</p>
				<ul class="custom-list">
					<li>a patient supported by an experienced care navigator;</li>
					<li>payment in advance of surgery;</li>
					<li>prescreened patients (reducing the risk of complications);</li>
					<li>eliminating the cost of working with traditional payers; and</li>
					<li>increased utilization based on the provider’s schedule.</li>
				</ul>
				<p class="mt-2">If you would like to learn more about Spoke’s provider program and how to join, please contact Richard Coyte at <a href="mailto:richard@spokehealth.com">richard@spokehealth.com</a>.</p>
