				<p>Spoke Health<span class="trademark">&trade;</span> and Savvy Benefits<span class="trademark">&trade;</span> announced a partnership through which Savvy will promote Spoke Health’s flagship product, <b>SurgeryHub<span class="trademark">&trade;</span></b>, to Savvy’s clients. The relationship increases Spoke’s covered lives by orders of magnitude, and allows Savvy to increase the savings it delivers to its clients.</p>

				<p>With the ever-increasing cost of healthcare, reducing the cost of surgeries is now recognized as one of the greatest opportunities for self-insured employers to reduce their healthcare spend while providing the best possible level of service for their employees.</p>

				<p>Spoke Health CEO, Richard Coyte, explained why the company chose Savvy Benefits:</p>
				
				<blockquote>
					<p>We’re excited about Savvy Benefits because of its record in employee engagement. Whenever Savvy enters the employer-employee ecosystem, program usage at least doubles. That expertise adds tremendous value to our constituents. Our program delivers value to employees and employers by helping employees access affordable surgical services. Today, right now, all across the country, people are putting off procedures that would greatly increase their quality of life and productivity. The reason? They can’t afford it. If we can’t reach that person, we lose the opportunity to serve the employee and capture savings for their employers.</p>
					<footer>— Richard Coyte, Spoke Health<span class="trademark">&trade;</span> CEO</footer>
				</blockquote>

				<p>Judd Wagner, CEO of Savvy Benefits, said:</p>

				<blockquote>
					<p>Spoke’s unique approach to surgery-savings is what caught our attention. Everyone talks about a market-based approach to healthcare pricing but no one has done it, certainly not at scale. Spoke has the first direct-to-provider program that leverages the power of the individual, matching them to the best local providers. Equally impressive is the platform’s ability to make shopping for surgery-providers feel completely natural. It’s like nothing we’ve seen. The end result is greater savings for both the employee and employer.</p>

				<p>Messrs. Wagner and Coyte have plans to expand the scope of this partnership to increase the value proposition to constituents beyond self-insured employers.</p>
