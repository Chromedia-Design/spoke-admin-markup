						<h3>Who we are</h3>
					</div>
					<p>At Spoke<span class="trademark">&trade;</span>, we work with only the best local physician-owned hospitals and surgery centers on a per-employee basis. Our goal is to help our clients, large self-insured employers, steer their employees to the best local facilities, while also reducing the burden on those facilities’ front-line personnel and IT staff.</p>
					<p>Spoke<span class="trademark">&trade;</span> works by focusing on individual patients, rather than negotiated volume.</p>
					<p> Because of this individual focus we:</p>
					<ul class="custom-list">
						<li>engage and interact with employees when they are most likely to need surgical intervention, pulling them away from inefficient traditional hospital settings;</li>
						<li>maximize a facility’s operating theater and beds by asking for available scheduling options for each patient;</li>
						<li>assign a dedicated advocate to facilitate the integration of a patient from spoke to a facility, and assist in any issues;</li>
						<li>don’t ever require a facility to accept a patient;</li>
						<li>simplify billing so there are no claims to file, no complicated billing systems for staff to learn or for IT to integrate, and no delayed payment or patient accounts receivable to collect.</li>
					</ul>

						<h3>Why should you be a part of Spoke<span class="trademark">&trade;</span></h3>
					</div>
					<p>As a Physician-owned Facility, your focus is on driving down costs while increasing efficiency, streamlining your organization and processes in a way that traditional hospitals cannot hope to compete with. It’s this drive and clarity that makes you the optimal partner for Spoke. We partner with you to increase these efficiencies by providing access to patients that otherwise would have been unreachable, and without impacting your price structure or system. Our goal for our partner facilities is to make acquiring patients as easy as possible. And by arranging for payment prior to the procedure, we remove any risk of delinquency, and the hassle associated with pursuing outstanding claims. We allow you to focus on doing the things that make you a top facility, all the while giving you a channel to access new patients.</p>

						<h3>The Business Model</h3>
					</div>
					<p>We provide a benefit package to self-insured employers that focuses on addressing the needs of their employees that require surgical procedures. Rather than allowing patients to passively funnel into hospital setting by traditional referral mechanics, we provide visibility into alternatives. As you realize, the highest cost providers in a given market are not necessarily the top providers in terms of outcomes. By focusing on a more specialized subset of procedures, surgery centers are uniquely positioned to provide better results at pricing that is competitive with hospitals. Our program illuminates these alternatives to patients before they make a decision.</p>
