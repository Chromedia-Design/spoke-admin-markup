					<h5>Overview</h5>
				</div>
				<p>Denver Spine Surgeons is a group practice composed of three board-certified, fellowship-trained orthopedic spine surgeons. Our philosophy emphasizes exhausting non-surgical treatment options before considering spine surgery. When surgery is necessary, we utilize the latest technological advances in minimally invasive spine.</p>
				<p>Dr. David Wong, Dr. Sanjay Jatana and Dr. Gary Ghiselli have practiced together in Denver as colleagues for about 10 years and have over 60 years combined performing spine surgery! The three spine specialists are referred back pain and neck pain patients from across the Front Range of the Rocky Mountains; Colorado Springs; Summit County, Colorado; as well as from adjacent states of New Mexico, Nebraska, Wyoming and Kansas.</p>
				<p>Our doctors emphasize non-surgical treatment options in advance of spine surgery through a network of pain management specialists and spine therapists. Back and neck pain patients can often recover nonsurgically by working with physical medicine and rehabiliation (PMR) physicians and spine-specialized therapists, who use customized movements and exercises to help make the back stronger, more flexible and resistant to injury. When surgery is necessary, the spine surgeons perform minimally invasive spine surgery so the patient can be home later the same day to recover in the comfort of their own home.</p>
				
				<p><b>Establishing the diagnosis</b></p>
				<p>Sometimes even with a good set of X-rays or MRI scans, the root cause of your pain is not easy to identify. That can be especially true when it happens in the cervical spine or neck area. There are some basic things we look for that can help us determine exactly what is going on. We may try some nonsurgical therapies first to see if the problem improves or persists. We will not schedule surgery until we completely diagnose the source of the pain.</p>
				<p>Once we decide if surgery is appropriate, we will begin to prepare you for what you can expect. We will talk with you about getting ready for surgery, the operation, and typical hospital stays and recovery time. We will also talk with you about physical therapy and post-surgical follow-up care.</p>
				
				<p><b>Surgical Consultation</b></p>
				<p>A good doctor knows how to listen. At Denver Spine Surgeons, your surgical consultation is an opportunity for us to get to know you. During the exam, we will inquire about your medical history, your family medical history, any previous injuries you may have suffered, any previous surgeries, if you were hurt on the job or in an accident, how long have you been in pain, and any medications or treatments you’ve taken.</p>
				<p>Is your back pain isolated to just one location? Does it radiate down your arms or legs? How is your diet? How often do you exercise? What are your expectations from back surgery? What are your fears? The information we gather from this consultation, along with MRI scans and medical records from referring physicians, helps us determine the next step in your treatment.</p>
				<p>In the case of children with spinal deformities, genetic factors may play a role. A thorough consultation examines all the physical, genetic and environmental factors that can help us determine the extent of the problem and the appropriate treatment plan.</p>
				
				<p><b>Spine Surgery</b></p>
				<p>Denver Spine Surgeons emphasizes non-surgical treatment options for radicular pain for 8 weeks in advance of recommending spine surgery. But once non-surgical options fail to work, we believe in speeding the person back to activity with a minimally invasive spine surgery that can be done in day surgery so they are back home the same day.</p>
				<p>The surgeons at Denver Spine Surgeons are fellowship-trained—the highest level of training in spine surgery. They are also board-certified and concentrate their practice exclusively on spine surgery. Their expertise includes minimally invasive spine surgery, all common surgical problems in the neck and low back, scoliosis care and surgery, as well as new innovations including total disc replacement. In addition, the surgeons at Denver Spine Surgeons are already referred some of the most complex spine cases throughout the Denver region and have extensive experience with cervical myelopathy, deformity surgery and revision surgery. This experience translates into improved patient care of all spinal problems.</p>
				
				<p><b>Minimally Invasive Surgery</b> - Spine surgery then home, same day</p>
				<p>Denver Spine Surgeons uses state of the art minimally invasive techniques and instrumentation to help patients recover in a shorter period of time and allow for a quicker return home. Innovative developments in minimally invasive techniques have pioneered better ways for the surgeon to access the spine, moreover making the recovery process more seamless.</p>
				<p>In minimally invasive spine surgery, a smaller incision is made, sometimes only a half-inch in length. The surgeon inserts special surgical instruments through these tiny incisions to access the damaged disc in the spine. Entry and repair to the damaged disc or vertebrae is achieved without harming nearby muscles and tissues when using minimally invasive techniques.</p>
				<p>Minimally invasive spine surgery requires extensive training and experience to master use of the tools, but there is tremendous benefit for the patient. "The incision is shorter, which means you aren’t cutting through as much muscle and tissue to get access to the damaged area of the spine,” explains Dr. Wong.</p>
				<p>Benefits of minimally invasive spine surgery include:</p>
				<p><ul>
					<li>Smaller incision and smaller scar</li>
					<li>Less damage to tissues and muscles</li>
					<li>Less blood loss</li>
					<li>Less post-operative pain</li>
					<li>Less painful recovery</li>
					<li>Quicker return to activity</li>
				</ul></p>
				<p>Unlike many other spine care providers, some spine patients who undergo minimally invasive surgery at Denver Spine Surgeons can have their surgery on an outpatient basis and be home later the same day.
				All three surgeons at Denver Spine Surgeons share a common philosophy in that they emphasize nonsurgical treatment options in advance of spine surgery. Non-surgical treatment options are now provided through a larger network of pain management specialists and spine therapists. When surgery is necessary, the spine surgeons perform minimally invasive spine surgery so the patient can be home later the same day to recover in the comfort of their own home. Complex spine surgery, including fusion, instrumentation and artificial disc replacement is also provided in several different hospitals around the Denver area.</p>

					<h5>Procedure: Knee Replacement</h5>
				</div>
				<p>If painful joints are interfering with daily activities, it may be time to consider a surgical treatment option. A common type of knee surgery is knee replacement which falls into two categories: partial and total replacement. Knee surgery is performed to examine or repair tissues inside the knee joint using surgical instruments placed into the joint through small incisions.</p>

				   		<p>Many of us have back problems, it is a very wide problem for people, ever since we started walking on our tow legs and raised our backs a large percent of human have suffered pain in the back from different reasons. The chiropractic was invented to help solve or reduce back pain by training back experts that will offer help and relief to those needing back pain help.</p>
				   		<p>The great advantage that chiropractor have is the fact they focus only on the back, a chiropractor knows almost anything there is to know about the back, the spine, the nervous system structure and the biochemical patterns in the back, and that is the major reason why many people use chiropractors not only for help but also for a diagnosis that will send them the right way if the chiropractor couldn’t help.</p>
